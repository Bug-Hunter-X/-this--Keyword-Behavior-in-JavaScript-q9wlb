# JavaScript 'this' Keyword Quirks

This repository demonstrates the sometimes-unintuitive behavior of the `this` keyword in JavaScript.  Understanding how `this` is bound is crucial for avoiding common errors. 

The `bug.js` file contains code showcasing the unexpected variations in `this` depending on the function invocation context.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers strategies to manage and control `this` consistently.

**Key Concepts Illustrated:**

*   `this` in strict mode vs. non-strict mode
*   `this` in regular function calls
*   `this` in method calls (object methods)
*   `this` binding using `.bind()`

This example highlights the importance of explicit binding when dealing with functions that rely on the value of `this` to avoid potential unexpected behavior and runtime issues.
